# FilteringLibrary
Some implementations of a digital low, high, band pass and notch filters

to ensure the good working of filtering modules, the cut off frequency need to macth the nyquist standards (fc<=fs/2 -> the cut off frequency of the filter cannot be greater than the half of the sampling frequency)
